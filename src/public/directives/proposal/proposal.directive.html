        <h3>Introducing: Virtual Protests</h3>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Web & mobile app that enables you to express your opinion about any current event to "the goverment". the app facilitates virtual demonstrations that are formed on-the-fly by analyzing your free form text message (anything from a sentence or two to a literal manifesto) + an optional selfie image for context to correctly classify your issue and then combine it with others; delivering a complete consolidated analysis to the appropriate public official(s) at the federal, state and local levels.</p>
        <h4>Use case</h4>
        <p>a public policy matter is bothering you. you navigate to this new awesome site and impulsively send a freeform text message + an optional selfie or group selfie to "the powers that be". the app will do the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>analyze the text of your message for tone and context, identifying relationships to recent political events and policy discussions to determine if this is a federal, state or local matter. automatically categorize your message with dynamically-generated tag clouds.</li>
          <li>use geocoding to determine the exact public officials who influence the matter</li>
          <li>analyze the image for faces, demographic information, and tone. analyze for context in the image that might reinforce the message (location, gestures, text on signs / banners, etc)</li>
          <li>provide you with the option to either send the message anonymously, or to sign the message, including as much or as little personal information as you prefer</li>
          <li>provide an option to share your message on social media channels to invite others to join (sign onto) your message</li>
          <li>deliver your message to the appropriate public official(s). officials actually receive a regularly updated and fully digested executive summary report of consolidated analysis of constituents' sentiment on your issue and how it is trending.</li>
        </ol>
