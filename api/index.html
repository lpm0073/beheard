        <h1>Welcome to the Be Heard REST API!</h1>

        You have succesfully invoked this API. You are seeing this HTML page because the <code>GET</code> method to the root resource this API returns is content generated as a Mock integration.

        The Be Heard API provides read and write access to several resources. Many of these interact with a NoSQL database while a couple provide seamless integration to other AWS cloud infrastructure back end resources. This API primarily uses a web and computer-friendly data interchange format called JSON which enables this interface to efficiently send and receive text representations of complex data objects. You can read more about JSON <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">via this link</a>.

        <section>
          <h2>Resources you can retrieve with this API<h2>

          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>Though not currently implemented on the production site, the Be Heard API provides a full-featured comments api that is page-aware and can optionally be used to dump the entire comments database in JSON format.</p>

          <p>By making a <a href="/v1/comments/" target="_blank">GET request</a> to <code>/comments</code> you can retrieve a list of Comments in this API. You can optionall append the URI of one of the site's web page to retrieve only the comments made to that page. For example, to retreive the JSON objects representing the page comments from web site page "big-news-in-dc", you can would make a GET request to <code>/joinus/bid-news-in-dc</code>.</p>

          <h3>Mail List</h3>
          <p>A mail list sign up form exists on the landing page where visitors can add their email address to a newsletter database. You can download this database by making a <a href="/v1/maillist/" target="_blank">GET request</a> to <code>/maillist</code></p>

          <h3>Join Us</h3>
          <p>A "Join Us" form also exists on the landing page where visitors can leave their contact information if they'd like to get more involved with Be Heard. You can download the entire database  by making a <a href="/v1/joinus/" target="_blank">GET request</a> to <code>/joinus</code> or you can optionally append an email address of a single visitor to retrieve only one JSON record for that visitor. For example, to retreive the JSON object representing the visitor with email address "lpm0073@gmail.com", you can would make a GET request to <code>/joinus/lpm0073@gmail.com</code>.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Resources you can store in a cloud database with this API</h2>
          <p>You can use a REST client such as <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> to test the POST methods included in this API. Each of the <code>POST</code> API methods require a JSON "payload" that includes the data to be stored. Each method has it's own special format. You'll need to refer to the examples included in this section to create valid payloads.</p>

          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>You can upload a comment with a <code>POST</code> method to <code>/comments</code> and a payload of the following format included in the body of the http request:</p>
          	  	<pre>
  {
  	"pageId": "silly-web-page",
  	"userName": "mcdaniel0073",
  	"message": "this article should win a pultizer prize -- not!"
  }</pre>

          <h3>Mail List</h3>
          <p>You can upload a comment with a <code>POST</code> method to <code>/maillist</code> and a payload of the following format included in the body of the http request:</p>
          	  	<pre>
  {
  	"emailAddress": "a-valid-email-address@gmail.com"
  }</pre>


          <h3>Join Us</h3>
          <p>You can upload a comment with a <code>POST</code> method to <code>/joinus</code> and a payload of the following format included in the body of the http request:</p>
          	  	<pre>
  {
  	"emailAddress": "a-valid-email-address@gmail.com",
  	"firstName": "George",
  	"lastName": "Washington",
  	"comment": "Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah nannah nanna nah!",
  }</pre>

            <p>So what exactly is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a> api, and why is it important? And while we're at it, what in the heck is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">JSON</a>? Imagine a super-duper universal adaptor that could connect any source input to any output. That would be pretty cool! In a nutshel that is a REST api implemented using JSON. A REST api provides a standardized way for any Internet-connected device to access any kind of Internet-accessible resource. a REST api makes it possible to create a single back end that is used by web sites, mobile apps, and IoT devices, providing a consistent user experience across all of these different kinds of devices.</p>

            <h3>Why do they matter?</h3>
            <p>A REST api creates an import layer of abstraction between the details and nuances of back end computing and storage resources, and the specifics of the many different kinds of front end devices that rely on those resources. Designers and technology professionals have become increasing specialized, and, they increasingly work in disparate teams; often at entirely different companies. Meanwhile, the release cycles of typical web apps and Internet services have accelerated so much over the last decade that may companies release new features multiple times a day. This is made possible in large part because individual team members are able to work autonomously, without the need to synchronize logistical requirements.</p>
            <p>JSON is an important piece of the puzzle as well. JSON makes it possible to transfer complex data ojbects between front and back ends using a simple text format. When fused with the Internet's standard https protocol, end-to-end SSL encryption, and the REST standard it becomes possible to implement rich and highly sophisticated data-driven features across an infinite variety of Internet-connected devices. With REST and JSON technology teams would collapse from the unweildly complexity created by having to consider the implications of multitudes of back end infrastructure provisioning conserations against a blistering array of different front end technologies and physical presentation formats.</p>

            <h3>Why do they matter?</h3>
            <p>JSON can be imported to/from desktop applications like MS Access and MS Excel with several free online tools. It is also rumored that Microsoft will include JSON data connectors in forthcoming releases of MS Office.

            <h2>About this api</h2>
            <p>This api is implemented as a Microservice using Amazon Web Services cloud infrasture components and services. Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development to speed up deployment cycles, foster innovation and ownership, and improve maintainability and scalability of software applications - as well as scaling organizations delivering software and services. Using a microservices approach, software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small selfcontained teams.</p>
            <p>Microservices were first pioneered by Amazon.com as a way to overcome crippling complexity in its constantly evolving flagship online store. The approached was later adopted by fast-growth silicon valley startups like Twitter, Facebook, Ube and AirBnb and has sinced become a best practice approach to systems planning with companies of all sizes.</p>
          <h3>Microservice Versus Traditional Infrastructure Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Microservices provide several immediate benefits to businesses; especially of the early-stage high growth variety. First, microservices typcially are created from managed web infrastructure services that require little or no adminstrative know-how. Further, the back end computing and storage resources as well as much of the complexity of implementing and managing security features are all abstracted away. This essentially enables a pure and infinitely scalable "pay as your go" paradigm to businesses. Further, much of the IT burden is eliminated such as disaster recovery planning, data backup-restore, system documetation, and so on.

          <h3>HTTPS and CORS</h3>
          <p>
            This api is highly secure. Some of the security features are visible and verifiable. You'll notice for example that this api runs over a secure SSL-encryption connection. By experimentation you'll also see that the "write" features of the api only work when called from https://beheard.lawrencemcdaniel.com, which is by no means accidental. Importantly, this api is open and available to public, but is also highly secure meanwhile requiring no user authentication credentials. That's pretty cool! This is all made possible with the standard Internet HTTPS protocol and a newish standard called CORS (Cross-O-Resource-Sharing)
