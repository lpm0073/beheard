About this interface
- Micro Services and Serverless Architectures: https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/microservices-on-aws.pdf
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software
development to speed up deployment cycles, foster innovation and ownership,
and improve maintainability and scalability of software applications - as well as
scaling organizations delivering software and services. Using a microservices
approach, software is composed of small independent services that
communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small selfcontained
teams.
